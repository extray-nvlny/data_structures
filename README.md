# data_structures
I have started learning classic data structures and decided upload to this repository my implementations

1) ***Single linked list*** 

Single linked list is a linear data structure chained by pointers whose points to the next element in the list.The principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that the list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure because the data items need not be stored contiguously in memory or on disk, while restructuring an array at run-time is a much more expensive operation

Each record of a linked list is often called an 'element' or 'node'.
